### Rauf Salamzade - Grad Student @ University of Wisconsin - Madison / Kalan Lab

Hi there, my name is Rauf, I have been working in the field of microbial bioinformatics since 2013 and started my PhD in microbiology in Fall 2020. Some software I have developed include:

:snake: = *on Bioconda*; :whale2: = *on Docker Hub*; :pie::pie: = *on PyPi*

#### Active development:

* [*zol (& fai)*](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/zol): :snake: :whale2: suite for evolutionary and functional analysis of gene clusters (co-located sets of genes).
* [skDER (& CiDDER)](): :snake: programs for genomic dereplication using ANI and pan-genome saturation approximation.
* [*lsa*BGC-Pan](https://github.com/Kalan-Lab/lsaBGC-Pan): :snake: suite/workflow for pan-BGC-ome analyses.
* [codoff](): :snake::pie::pie:   program to statistically assess differences in codon usage between a focal region and the background genome.
  
#### Supported but no longer in active development:

* [*lsa*BGC]():
* [ConSequences]():
* [seQouia]():
* [AncestralGeneRator]():
* [PerMutation]():
